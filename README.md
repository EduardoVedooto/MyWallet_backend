## About

## Motivations to delevop this project

- One of the mainly motivations to do this project was to learn more about REST API and integration tests. It was really challenging in some parts, especially in its tests. Besides, I liked the objective of it, which I explains better in the frontend repository.

## Functionalities (Routes)

- Sign in (POST/signin)
